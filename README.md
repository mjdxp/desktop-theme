# desktop-theme
This is the retro CDE inspired theme I use on my computer.

2. In your home directory, create the `.themes` directory (if it doesn't already exist). Copy the `desktop-theme-main` directory here (you can rename it to whatever you'd like).

3. Open Xfce's Appearance settings. Make sure "Set matching Xfwm4 theme if there is one" is checked. Select the `desktop-theme-main` option. The theme will apply to your system.

## Suggested Configurations
I personally use the Hedera icon theme: https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1207800

I use the Terminus font for titlebars and monospaced fonts: https://terminus-font.sourceforge.net/
The package name will vary based on your operating system. I suggest searching "terminus" with your package manager to find it.

I use Ubuntu Regular as my system font.
